    Evaluate this haiku on a 1-5 scale considering:
    - Does it follow the 5-7-5 syllable structure?
    - Is the imagery evocative and original?
    - Does it meaningfully engage with the AI theme?
    - Is there depth or a surprising turn?
    A 3 means competent but unremarkable. A 5 means genuinely memorable.
    Be very discriminating - most haiku are 2-3 range.
