prompt: "Explain why the sky is blue in two sentences."
response: |
  The sky appears blue because molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter shorter
  wavelengths of sunlight (blue and violet) more than longer wavelengths like
  red and orange. Since our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and violet
  light is largely absorbed higher in the atmosphere, we perceive the sky as blue.
