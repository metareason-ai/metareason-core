prompt: "Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning."
response: |
  Supervised learning uses labeled data where inputs are paired with known outputs,
  and the model learns to map inputs to outputs. Common examples include
  classification and regression. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data
  and tries to find hidden patterns or structure, like clustering similar items
  together. The key difference is that supervised needs a "teacher" (labels) while
  unsupervised discovers patterns on its own.
