prompt: "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement to a college student."
response: |
  Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum physics where two particles
  become connected in such a way that measuring one instantly affects the other,
  regardless of distance. Think of it like having two magic coins - when you
  flip one and it lands heads, the other will always land tails, no matter how
  far apart they are. Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance."
